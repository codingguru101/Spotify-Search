# Spotify-Search


Simple React JS App that allows you to search for any artist that is on the spotify platform the app works by authorzing a 
spotify user to sign in with their spotify credentials which then gives and access token to the api which then will allow 
the fetching of Data from the Spotify API. This app is currently in the begining stages and I am just testing the capabilities 
of the Spotify API and I will in future developments add more functionality to this app to allow more detailed search params
as well as music playback and playlists directly in the app.
